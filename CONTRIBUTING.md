# Contributing to LeetCode City

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ixotic27/The-Leetcode-City.git
cd leetcode-city
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in your keys (see .env.example for details)
npm run dev
```

The app runs on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- A Supabase project (free tier works)
- A GitHub personal access token (for API calls)
- Stripe test keys (only if working on payments)

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values. Here is a summary of what each variable does:

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Yes | Base URL for the app (e.g. `http://localhost:3001` locally) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Your Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Supabase anonymous/public key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Yes | Supabase service role key (server-side only, keep secret) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes | GitHub personal access token for API calls |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Optional | Stripe secret key — only needed for payment features |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Optional | Stripe webhook secret — only needed for payment features |
| `ABACATEPAY_API_KEY` | Optional | AbacatePay key — only needed for BRL payment support |
| `ABACATEPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Optional | AbacatePay webhook secret |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIMETRICA_API_KEY` | Optional | Himetrica analytics key |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Optional | Resend email key — used for ad expiry notification emails |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Optional | Secret token to authenticate Vercel cron job requests |

> **Tip:** For local development you only need the Supabase, GitHub token, and base URL variables. Stripe, AbacatePay, Resend, and Himetrica keys are only required if you are actively working on those features.

## Code Style

- TypeScript everywhere
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Pixel font (Silkscreen) for UI text
- React Three Fiber (R3F) + drei for 3D
- App Router (Next.js 16)

Run `npm run lint` before submitting.

## Making Changes

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch from `main` and name it with the issue number and name (e.g. `git checkout -b 12-issue-name`). 
> **🛑 STOP:** Do NOT commit your changes to your fork's `main` branch. You MUST create a new branch. Pull Requests submitted from a `main` or `master` branch will be automatically rejected by our bots.
3. Make your changes
4. Run `npm run lint` and fix any issues
5. Commit with a clear message (e.g. `feat: add rain weather effect`)
6. Open a Pull Request against `main`. **Please make sure to fill out the Pull Request template provided.**

### Automated PR Review

To help maintain code quality and provide immediate feedback, this repository has an **Automated AI PR Reviewer** integrated via GitHub Actions. 
When you open a Pull Request, the AI will automatically review your changes, provide a summary, and suggest potential improvements directly in the PR comments. Please consider the AI's suggestions and apply them if they improve your code!

## Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/Ixotic27/The-Leetcode-City/labels/good%20first%20issue). These are scoped tasks that don't require deep knowledge of the codebase.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  app/          # Next.js App Router pages and API routes
  components/   # React components (UI + 3D)
  lib/          # Utilities, Supabase clients, helpers
  types/        # TypeScript types
public/         # Static assets (audio, images)
supabase/       # Database migrations
```

## 3D / Three.js

The city is rendered with React Three Fiber. Key files:

- `src/components/CityScene.tsx` - Main 3D scene
- `src/components/Building.tsx` - Individual building rendering
- `src/lib/zones.ts` - Item definitions for building customization

If you're adding a new building effect or item, start with `zones.ts`.

## Troubleshooting

**`npm run dev` fails with a Supabase error**
Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set correctly in `.env.local`.

**GitHub API rate limit errors**
Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a valid personal access token with at least `read:user` and `public_repo` scopes.

**Port 3001 already in use**
Kill the process using port 3001, or change `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and the dev server port in `package.json`.

**TypeScript errors after pulling latest changes**
Run `npm install` to pick up any new dependencies, then `npm run lint` to surface type issues.
